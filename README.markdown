This is [rionexe/moviematch-v2](https://github.com/rionexe/moviematch-v2), a
fork of [LukeChannings/moviematch](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch)
v2, rebranded as **Willow & Wit** with a redesigned glassmorphism UI, a
light/dark theme selector, and several feature and bugfix additions beyond
upstream. See [RELEASE_NOTES.markdown](./RELEASE_NOTES.markdown) and the
[git history](https://github.com/rionexe/moviematch-v2/commits/main) for the

Have you ever spent longer deciding on a movie than it'd take to just watch a
random movie? This is an app that helps you and your friends pick a movie to
watch from a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) server.

## How it works

MovieMatch connects to your Plex server and gets a list of movies (from any
libraries marked as a movie library).

As many people as you want connect to your MovieMatch server and get a list of
shuffled movies. Swipe right to 👍, swipe left to 👎.

If two (or more) people swipe right on the same movie, it'll show up in
everyone's matches. The movies that the most people swiped right on will show up
first.

## What's different from upstream

- **Willow & Wit rebrand and theme selector** — Forest/Ocean glass themes plus
  Parchment (light) and Willow Night (dark), switchable in the UI.
- **Library room filter** — filter rooms by Plex library/folder in addition to
  the existing tag/genre/etc. filters, since Plex doesn't expose that natively.
- **Swipe undo** and session-resume reliability improvements.
- **IMDb badge** on cards, Plex-branded "open in Plex" link.
- Numerous glassmorphism UI polish passes (card stack, matches carousel,
  filter row layout, dropdown positioning, scrollbars, etc).

## Getting started

`docker run -it -e PLEX_URL=<Plex URL> -e PLEX_TOKEN=<Your Token> -p 8000:8000 --pull always rionexe/moviematch-v2:latest`

**Note**: There is also documentation for **docker-compose** over

## FAQ

### Can a user get my Plex Token?

No. The client never talks directly to the Plex server and any requests that
need the token (e.g. querying movies, getting poster art) are made by the
server.

Only a subset of the Plex response is given to the client to minimise the chance
of sensitive information leaking out. All server logs have both `PLEX_URL` and
`PLEX_TOKEN` replaced with `****` to prevent accidental disclosure.

### Can it do TV shows too?

Yes, you can include a TV library in your `LIBRARY_TITLE_FILTER` list.

### Do you gather any data?

No. The server is entirely local to you and will work offline.

### Do you support languages other than English?

Yes. The server will use your browser's preferred language by default if it's
supported. Otherwise it'll fall back to English.

The translations can be found in [configs/localization](./configs/localization).

The file names follow [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) naming. Feel
free to submit a Pull Request if you'd like your language to be supported.

### Can I run MovieMatch behind a reverse proxy?

Yes, you can read some documentation [here](./docs/reverse-proxy.markdown)

### MovieMatch crashes on startup with an error!

#### dns error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known

This is an issue with your DNS configuration, try using an IP address for Plex
instead of a domain name as a workaround. See
[#70](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/issues/70) for more details.

#### tcp connect error: Connection refused

MovieMatch can't connect to Plex due to your network configuration, see
[#51](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/issues/51) for ideas on how to
debug.
